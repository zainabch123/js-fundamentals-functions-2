// 1. To help Phil keep track of his baking time, create a function named
// timerStatus that accepts one parameter:
// - the remaining minutes left on a timer
// The function must return "Phil's cake is ready!" if the remaining minutes is 0,
// "The cake is still baking!" if there are any remaining minutes left,
// or "You didn't set a timer!" if no value is provided to the parameter

function timerStatus(a) {
  if (a == undefined) {
    console.log(0);
    return "You didn't set a timer!";
    console.log(1);
  } else if (a = 0) {
    return "Phil's cake is ready!";
    console.log(2);
  } else if (a > 0) {
    return "The cake is still baking!";
    console.log(3);
  }
}

console.log(timerStatus(7));

// 2. To help Phil prepare ahead of time, create a function named estimatePrepTime
// that accepts two parameters:
// - an array of ingredients (e.g. ["sugar", "milk", "flour", "eggs"])
// - the prep time per ingredient in minutes
// The function must return the total prep time the cake will require based on the
// number of ingredients provided and the prep time per ingredient.
// If no prep time per ingredient is provided, the function should assume each ingredient
// takes 2 minutes to prepare

// 3. Phil needs to know the quantity of milk and eggs to use! Create a function
// named calculateQuantities which accepts two parameters:
// - a list of ingredients
// - how many layers the cake has
// The cake will need 100g of sugar per layer and 2 eggs per layer, if those ingredients are present.
// The function should always return an object with two keys: sugar, eggs
// The values of the keys should be the total amount of sugar and eggs needed for the cake.
// If sugar or eggs are not present in the list of ingredients, the value for the key should be 0
//
// Example:
// calculateQuantities(["sugar", "milk", "eggs"], 2)
// returns: { sugar: 200, eggs: 4 }
//
// calculateQuantities(["milk", "eggs"], 3)
// returns: { sugar: 0, eggs: 6 }

// 4. Phil's cake is pretty small and only provides 1 portion. He wants to make a bigger one!
// Create a function named improveRecipe that accepts two parameters:
// - an object where the keys are ingredients and the values are quantities
//      e.g. { eggs: 2, milk: 100, sugar: 250, flour: 160 }
// - the number of portions the cake should provide
//
// The function should return a new object with the same keys as the recipe provided,
// but the values should have updated amounts to make sure the cake provides enough portions.
//
// Example:
// improveRecipe({ eggs: 2, milk: 100, sugar: 200 }, 3)
// returns: { eggs: 6, milk: 300, sugar: 600 }
